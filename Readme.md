# Rock, Paper Scissors Game

Rock, paper, scissors (also known as Rochambeau, Roshambo, or Janken) is a fun and easy hand game that anyone can learn and enjoy. It’s a great way to make minor decisions when you and a friend can’t agree on something, or even just an entertaining way to pass the time.


It's a digital version of the Evergreen Rock, Paper Scissors game.

After you’ve both played an object, see who’s won. Each object wins against one shape and loses to another. For instance, rock “crushes” scissors but is “covered” by paper, paper “covers” rock but is “cut” by scissors, and scissors is “crushed” by rock but “cuts” paper. The player who picks the stronger of the two objects is the winner.

If both players throw the same object, it’s a tie. In this situation, play again. Continue doing this until there is a clear winner.

Many people choose to do “best of 3” or “best of 5” since rock paper scissors is a quick and easy game.

If you play with more than 2 players, continue playing rounds until there’s one player left standing.
